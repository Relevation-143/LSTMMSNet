LSTM-MSNet: Leveraging Forecasts on Sets of Related Time Series with Multiple Seasonal Patterns
===================

This page contains the explanation of our LSTM-MSNet forecast framework, which can be used to forecast a sets of time series with multiple seasonal patterns.

In the description, we first provide a breif introduction to our methdology, and then explain the steps to be followed to execute our code and use our framework for your research work.
